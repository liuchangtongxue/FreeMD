# FreeMD: Training-Free Multi-domain Text-to-Image Generation with Any Control
This is the official implementation for paper "FreeMD: Training-Free Multi-domain Text-to-Image Generation with Any Control"

- We propose FreeMD, a novel training-free multi-domain text-to-image generation method to realize better semantic alignment with text prompt and achieve excellent structure consistency with structure control simultaneouslyprompts, including box, keypoints and images.
- We analyze the effects of query ($Q$), key ($K$), value ($V$) and self-attention map ($S$) on the structure and appearance.
- we investigate the relationship between frequency domain features and structure control because high-frequency features are good at expressing more texture detail and edge structure.
